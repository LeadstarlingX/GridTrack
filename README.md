# GridTrack

Real-time fleet tracking & dispatch for a Damascus delivery fleet — PostGIS dispatch,
Redis Streams → SignalR live map, ClickHouse history, and a Python AI pipeline
(urgency / demand-surge / forecast).


> **Test environment:** GitHub Actions `ubuntu-latest` (2 vCPU, 7 GB RAM).  
> These results measure behavior under shared-runner constraints, not bare-metal performance.  
> For production capacity planning, run `task k6-stress` on hardware matching your deployment target.
